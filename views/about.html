        <p>In the first module, we learnt how to use the list of tools below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>DOM</li>
            <li>Canvas</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The objective of the first project was to demonstrate the level of expertiese obtained
            in each one of the tools making a game.</p>
        <p>My game's name is Solo-pong and its Arcanoid clone.
            If you are an arcanoid nostalig, this game is made for you.</p>
        <p>The main lessons I took from making this game were</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Class features</li>
            <li>DOM manipulation</li>
            <li>Canvas</li>
            <li>Patience</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The more I learn, the more I love programming.I have come to the conclusion
            that it's a great exercise for the mind and this is something anyone can benefit from.</p>
