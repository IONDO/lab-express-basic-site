        <p>The purpose of this practice is to create a server
            and creat basic requests and responses to these requests.</p>
        <p>However, I am not only going to use it as a server practice,
            I am also going to take advantage of this creation and convert it
            into my module 1 project's side.
        </p>
        <p>Ironhack's web development boot-camp is divided in three modules.
            For each module, we have to make a project.
        </p>
        <p>So far, I have completed the module 1 project's and
            as I said before, I will take this opportunity to create a web page for my first project.</p>
        <p>With no further due, please, feel free to visit the about and the gallery pages and I hope you enjoy the
            content.</p>
